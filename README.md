## Overview

In this Project we have used Python to deal with a messy data set, and analyze and process it into valuable data, from which we have been able to extract valuable insights and information.

The data set was extracted from Global Shark Attack File. It consists of current and historical data of shark/human interactions, with the aim of better understanding these interactions, and minimize the risk of being injured by a shark, while contributing in the conservation of shark species worldwide.
